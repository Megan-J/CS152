PART 3 -- Write a visitor
----------------------------
Use the same directory structure as in part 2 of the assignment.  Download ExpressionBuilderVisitor.java and Interpreter.java and put them in src/edu/sjsu/fwjs/.

ExpressionBuilderVisitor.java constructs an AST of Expressions (from Expression.java).  Complete this code.  Once you have it working, you can use Interpreter.java (replacing the previous Interpreter.java) to interpret the scripts in the fwjsScripts directory.

The new version of the Makefile contains a 'run' target that will execute all of the fwjs scripts that you have been provided.

When you have completed this assignment, submit a zip file with the following directory structure (and no additional files):
